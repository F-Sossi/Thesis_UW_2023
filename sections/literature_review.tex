\section{Initial Literature Review}

The investigation of the area of keypoint descriptor methodologies in computer vision has led to innovative strides, particularly in the realm of keypoint recognition and image matching. This literature review underscores these advancements, contextualizing them in light of this study's objective: to enhance the precision and efficiency of descriptor pooling strategies for optimized performance in computer vision applications.

\subsection{Incorporation of Color Attributes in Descriptors}

The integration of color attributes in descriptors has shown promise in enhancing recognition capabilities. C. F. Olson and S. Zhang \cite{olson2016keypoint} introduced an innovative descriptor, Histograms of Normalized Colors (HoNC), which computes normalized color histograms within each grid cell of the array used in the SIFT descriptor. Their work demonstrates the potential benefits of color attributes, which is pertinent to this study's exploration of diverse descriptor pooling strategies.

\subsection{Exploration of Multi-Scale Descriptors}

In a significant contribution, J. Lee, E. Park, and S. Yoo \cite{lee2023multi} explored the potential of multi-scale descriptors. Their advocacy for a more comprehensive approach to descriptor methodology, especially at varying scales, aligns with this research's endeavor to examine a range of pooling strategies across different descriptor configurations.

\subsection{Advancements in Descriptor Robustness and Efficiency}

X. Zhao, X. Wu, W. Chen, P. C. Chen, Q. Xu, and Z. Li \cite{zhao2023aliked} proposed the ALIKED method, incorporating a deformable transformation into the descriptors to enhance their robustness while reducing computational overhead. This efficiency in descriptor processing resonates with this study's objective to optimize descriptor pooling strategies without compromising on performance.

\subsection{Synthesis and Research Trajectory}

The existing literature advocates for continuous exploration in descriptor methodologies, suggesting that innovative pooling strategies could unlock higher levels of precision and efficiency in computer vision applications. This research, through its focus on enhancing descriptor pooling strategies, seeks to contribute to this evolving narrative, potentially leading to advancements in both theoretical and practical realms of computer vision.
