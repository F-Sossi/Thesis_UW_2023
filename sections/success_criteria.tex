Success for this project is defined across three tiers: minimum, expected, and aspirational criteria, enabling a clear framework for evaluating progress and outcomes.

\textbf{Minimum Criteria:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Successful implementation and documentation of at least two descriptor pooling strategies.
    \item Demonstration of basic functionality and potential advantages over traditional methods.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Expected Criteria:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Implementation of a wider range of pooling strategies and their integration with existing descriptors.
    \item Quantifiable improvement in key performance metrics over baseline descriptors.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Aspirational Criteria:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Development of novel pooling strategies that set new standards for descriptor performance.
    \item Significant contribution to the field of computer vision, recognized through publication or widespread adoption.
\end{itemize}

Quality is measured by the accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of the pooled descriptors in various computer vision tasks.
