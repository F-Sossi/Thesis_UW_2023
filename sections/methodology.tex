The project methodology is designed to systematically address the research objectives through the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Literature Review and Descriptor Selection:} Identifying promising descriptors and pooling strategies from current literature.
    \item \textbf{Implementation:} Developing software implementations for selected descriptors and pooling strategies.
    \item \textbf{Optimization:} Applying optimization techniques to enhance performance and efficiency of the implemented methods.
    \item \textbf{Benchmarking:} Evaluating the performance of pooled descriptors against established benchmarks using precision, recall, and computational efficiency as key metrics.
\end{enumerate}

This structured approach ensures thorough exploration and evaluation of descriptor pooling strategies, facilitating meaningful contributions to the field of computer vision.
